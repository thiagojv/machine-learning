- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
  - (+) Takes average of probability of some input to predit the output.
  - (+) Prediction interpolates the observations
  - (-) They lose efficiency in high dimensional spaces
  - Applied on text classification (documents and spam detection)
  
- Decision Trees
  - (+) Requires little data preparation
  - (+) The cost of using the tree is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree
  - (+) Able to handle multi-output problems
  - (+) The explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic
  - (-) Can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well
  - (-) Concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily
  - (-) Create biased trees if some classes dominate
  - Guidance in the choice of a particular product based on customer features or preferences
